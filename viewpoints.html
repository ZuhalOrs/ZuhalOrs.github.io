     <h2>Our Viewpoints</h2>
     <p>We made a list of our viewpoints so that citizens can see what our party thinks on such topics.</p>
     <h3>Equality</h3>
     <p> Wealth should be distributed on the basis of need. Some vulnerable people have greater need than others. We should all have our needs met by the society we live in. We should all work together to meet those needs.</p>
     <p>As humans are social animals – the natural relationship between them should be co-operation rather than competition. Social equality is important because it helps a community to bond together and work together for the common good.</p>

     <h3>Religion</h3>
     <p>Everyone has a freedom to celebrate their own cultural and religious holiday. People that follow a certain religion should have that day off, no questions asked.</p>

     <h3>Education</h3>
     <p>Everyone, no matter their race, background, sex etc., from age 4 to 20 have the right to free education.</p>

     <h3>Economy</h3>
     <p>We believe that social and economic decisions should be made by those whom they most affect. We want to meet the needs of the society, not profit from them.</p>
     <dl>
     <dd>- To meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve a more just society, many structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary Dutch can participate in the many decisions that affect our lives. we believe that social and economic decisions should be made by those whom they most affect. </dd>
     </dl>

     <h3>Enviroment</h3>
     <p>We believe that using the most envoriment friendly way can save our planet from running out of sources(?)</p>
     <dl>
     <dd>- Plastic packaging must be removed from supermarkets, and instead of plastic the costumers must bring their own bag or net bags should be provided.  (in the first time of not bringing any bag supermarkets give you the bag + the costumer card for free-they have the same barcode-, and in the second time you must pay for the bag. This way costumers and the market have a win-win situation.)</dd>
     </dl>

     <h3>Immigration</h3>
     <p>The procedure should be shorter. The immigrants should be treated like a citizen in the sense of respect and they should be put into only one asylum center until their procedure is done.</p>

     <h3>Healthcare</h3>
     <p>People with a low income should have free healthcare. Emergency service must be available for everyone and all the time. People shouldn’t have to make appointment for emergency service. Dutch people must stop saying it has to be natural. Everything should be person’s own choice (article 11 grondwet).</p>
